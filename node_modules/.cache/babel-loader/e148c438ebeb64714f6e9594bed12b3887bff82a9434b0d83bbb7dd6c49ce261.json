So we pass a maxRating prop to the StarRating component\n// and we use it in Array.from() to define length. We pass maxRating = 5 in the StarRating\n// component as prop to set a default value of 5 stars in case the user does not set the\n// max amount of stars. We also improve reusability with props(i.e. defining a public API\n// for consumers to use it (Watch Lecture 118 - Props as a component API for better\n// understanding. Also lecture 119 - Improvong reusability with props)). We do this by, for\n// example passing props like color and size as we did below in StarRating component\n// function and setting a default value for them and then using them inside textStyle\n// object used for styling. This object is now inside component function because everytime\n// style will depend on value passed. Similarly, starStyle object is inside Star component\n// function. We pass in a className prop in StarRating component function in case we want\n// to add some class to the component from css file. We add it to the overall container in\n// the returned JSX. Also, we passed a messages prop which is an empty array by default.\n// Instead of numbers for rating, we can pass in some messages and those messages will be\n// displayed in place of rating. We only want to use this messages array in case there are\n// some values in that array and also the number of elements in the array should be\n// correct(so if we allow for a rating between 1 and 5 and we have only 3 elements in the\n// array then it doesn't make a lot of sense). so we use this messages array in the\n// StarRating component function where the rating is displayed. First we check if the array\n// length is correct, if yes then if tempRating is used, we display message at tempRating –\n// 1 otherwise at rating - 1. If array length is not correct, then if rating is a falsy\n// value(i.e. 0) then we will display empty string(i.e.) nothing on the screen. We also\n// pass a defaultRating prop in the StarRating component and we initialize the rating state\n// based on that.\n// The consumer might actually need the rating state of the StarRating component function\n// outside of the component. We can see this in the fact that the Test component in\n// index.js file requires the rating state for displaying in th UI This movie was rated X\n// stars. So what the Test component needs is some state(as we can see it has movieRating\n// state) and it needs to update that state whenever we update the rating state below in\n// the StarRating component. So basically we want to give the consumer of this Test\n// component to pass in a set function. So the consumer specifies an onSetRating handler.\n// In this case what the Test component wants to pass in is the onSetRating function. So we\n// specify this as a prop(receive it in the StarRating component function) and it by\n// default doesn't need any defalut value. Then all we have to do is that in the\n// handleRating() function, we not only set the internal Rating(internal rating is set by\n// the setRating(rating) that we did in the handleRating() function) but also external\n// rating by doing onSetRating(rating). With this we give the outside Test component the\n// ability to get access to the internal state(rating state of the StarRating component)\n// right inside the Test component.\n// With propTypes, we can specify the type of value that we expect the consumer of the\n// component to pass in for each of the props. For example, we can specify that the\n// maxRating must be a number and nothing else. This is called type checking. If we\n// really care about this, we should just use TypeScript instead of JavaScript. Here we\n// use the built in porpTypes. For that we import it at the top. To do the type checking,\n// we use the component and we define the propTypes property on it and then we assign\n// those propTypes an object as just below(note that while importing at top, the first\n// letter 'P' is capital while defining the propType property on component below, the\n// first letter 'p) is small case:\nexport default function StarRating(_ref){var _ref$maxRating=_ref.maxRating,maxRating=_ref$maxRating===void 0?5:_ref$maxRating,_ref$color=_ref.color,color=_ref$color===void 0?\"#fcc419\":_ref$color,_ref$size=_ref.size,size=_ref$size===void 0?48:_ref$size,_ref$className=_ref.className,className=_ref$className===void 0?\"\":_ref$className,_ref$messages=_ref.messages,messages=_ref$messages===void 0?[]:_ref$messages,_ref$defaultRating=_ref.defaultRating,defaultRating=_ref$defaultRating===void 0?0:_ref$defaultRating,onSetRating=_ref.onSetRating;var _useState=useState(defaultRating),_useState2=_slicedToArray(_useState,2),rating=_useState2[0],setRating=_useState2[1];// this state is used because whenever\n//                            we click on one of the stars, then we want to display the\n//                            current rating in the paragraph element.
