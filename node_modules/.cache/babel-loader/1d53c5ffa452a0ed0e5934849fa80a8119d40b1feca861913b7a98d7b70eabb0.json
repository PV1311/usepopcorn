So in case movie data loading takes time, we see a flash where there is no content. So the movie data was loading but hadn't arrived yet. So now in the mean time we want to display some loading indicator. So in order to do that we have this state which tells UI that data is still being loaded and then as soon as the data has been loaded, we want to display that data and not that indicator anymore. In our effect, right before the fetching actually starts, we setIsLoading to true.\n  const [error, setError] = useState(\"\"); // we want to display the new error message that we throw below in case an error happens while fetching data, onto the screen instead of the Loading indicator. So this state is for that. It tells currently whether we have an error or not. Here it not a boolean but truly the error message. Based on this error state, we will conditionally render the ErrorMessage component which receives a messgae prop with some message that it will then display on the screen.\n\n  const query = \"interstellar\";\n\n  // At times of fetching data and dealing with asynchronous data, we need to assume that somethings can go wrong and therefore we also need to account for those situations by handling those errors.\n  useEffect(function () {\n    async function fetchMovies() {\n      try {\n        setIsLoading(true); // this tells UI that loadind is happening and we can then render the indicator over there. Then after everything is finished, we set isLoading state back to false as seen towards the end of the try{} block of this function\n        const res = await fetch(`http://www.omdbapi.com/?apiKey=${KEY}&s=${query}`);\n        if (!res.ok) throw new Error(\"Something went wrong with fetching movies!\"); // now in between fetching data, user's internet connection might break so app will always keep showing the Loading indicator making user beleive that data will arrive at some point. so when it happens we want to display an error message on screen. Now reacting to errors like this is not built into the fetch() function itself, we need to do it manually. Now here on the response object that we receive from the fetch() exists one ok property. So basically if the response is not ok, then we want to throw a new error. Now if we throw an error here, we need to wrap all our code into a try catch block.\n\n        const data = await res.json();\n        setMovies(data.Search);\n        console.log(movies); // here if we try to log the movies to the console, we get an empty array as a result. This happens becuase setting state is asynchronous. So after setting state in the just above line using setMovies(), it doesn't mean that it happens immediately. So it will happen after the function has been called. so right here in console.log(movies), we have stale state. So before, movies was just an empty array which gets logged. After some time we get the correct output. Now if we do this console.log() again, we get correct output. Now, the reson for getting two outputs is because of React's strict mode. So when strict mode is active in React 18, our effects will run not only once, but twice(but only in development. So when our application is in production, this will no longer be happening). This happens so REact can identify if there are some problems in our effects.\n      } catch (err) {\n        console.error(err.message); // err.message is the string that pass into throw new Error('') as above.\n        setError(err.message); // in case of error, we set the error state to the error string that we passed above while throwing error. Now based on this error state, we will conditionally render the ErrorMessage component which receives a messgae prop with some message that it will then display on the screen.\n      } finally {\n        setIsLoading(false); // Now in the returned JSX, we conditionally render the <Loader.> component if isLoading is true, but there are 2 more conditional renders with it. (Look and understand. if not understood, Watch Lecture 146 - Adding a loading state and Lecture 147 - Handling errors)\n      }\n    }\n\n    fetchMovies(); // here we just call the function\n  }, []); // useEffects() doesn't return anything so we don't store the resuukt into any variable but instead we pass in a function and this function is then called our effect and it contains the code that we want to run as a side effect(so basically that we want to register as a side effect to be executed at a certain point in time). We also need to pass in a second argumnent which is a dependency array. We'll learn about it as we proceed further. empty array as here means that the effect that we just specified here will only run on mount. Now ew can see that there are no infinite loops or requests. So now effect is only running as the component mounts. Now, whenever we need a lot of code to handle a promise, it's a lot easier and nicer to just have an async function. However if we write async nefore the function inside useEffect() here and use await inside it, we get an ESLint warning which tells us that effect callbacks are synchronous to prevent race conditions. So basically the effect function that we placed into useEffect() cannot return a promise which is what an async function does. So instead of doing diretly like this, we create a new function and place the async function there as we did here\n\n  // // We know we should never update state in render logic.\n  // // Basic idea is to fetch some movie data as soon as this App component here mounts for the very  first time.\n  // fetch(`http://www.omdbapi.com/?apiKey=${KEY}&s=interstellar`)\n  //   .then((res) => res.json())\n  //   .then((data) => console.log(data.Search)); // Now, this data fetching that we are doing here is actually introducing a side effect into the component's render logic. So it is clearly an interaction with an outside world which should never be allowed in render logic. Now, as we see here, if insetead of logging the fetched data on console, we set state here with the fetched data, in the Network tab we can see that it is running an infinite number of requests and it never really stops. So every second, our app is firing off multiple requests to this API. This happends because setting the state here in the render logic will then immediately cause the component to re-render itself again. However, as the component is re-rendered, the function here is executed again, which in turn will fetch again, which in turn will set the movies again as well and this whole thing starts over ad over again. So this is the reason why it is really not allowed to set state in the render logic. Now, we do actually need to set the movies here but without all the problems. So for that we need the useEffect() hoosk.\n\n  // // we see another example just below where wo use setWatched:\n  // // setWatched([[]]); // We did setWatched here immediately in the top level code to some empty array and then actually we do get a real error. We get the error of too many re-renders. It's because of this state setting right here in setWatched(). So if we are really setting state here in the top without being inside a .then() handler, then immediately REact will complain that there are too many renders which means we again entered that infinite loop where updating the state will cause a component to re-render, which will cause the state to be set, ad so on to infinity.\n\n  // so we can useEffect() hook for above. The idea of it is to give us a place where we can safely write side effects like the above one. But side effects registered with useEffect() hook will only be excuted after certain renders(for example, only write after initial render which is exactly what we are looking for in this situation).\n

Component composition is combining\n  //                               different components using the children prop or\n  //                               explicitly defined props. Ex as just below:\n  //\n  //                               function Modal({ children }){\n  //                                 return (\n  //                                   <div className=\"modal\">\n  //                                     {children}\n  //                                   >/div>\n  //                                 )\n  //                               }\n  //\n  //                               function Error() {\n  //                                 return <p>This went wrong!</p>\n  //                               }\n  //\n  //                               Now with Component composition we can simply do:\n  //                               <Modal>\n  //                                 <Error />\n  //                               </Modal>\n  //\n  //                               We can use component composition:\n  //                               1. When we want to create highly reusable and\n  //                                  flexible components (such as the modal window)\n  //                               2. To fix prop drilling problem (great for layouts)\n  //\n  //                               Now we use component composition to fix component\n  //                               drilling problem where we pass movies prop into the\n  //                               NavBar component and then from there into the\n  //                               NumResults component. Here we only have one leve of prop\n  //                               drilling. If we could use NumResults component right in\n  //                               the App component instead of the NavBar component, then\n  //                               we wouldn't have to pass the movies prop into the NavBar\n  //                               which will fix that prop drilling problem. So we do this\n  //                               with component composition as above.

instead display some loading indicator. So in case movie data loading takes time, we see a flash where there is no content. So the movie data was loading but hadn't arrived yet. So now in the mean time we want to display some loading indicator. So in order to do that we have this state which tells UI that data is still being loaded and then as soon as the data has been loaded, we want to display that data and not that indicator anymore. In our effect, right before the fetching actually starts, we setIsLoading to true.\n  const [error, setError] = useState(\"\"); // we want to display the new error message that we throw below in case an error happens while fetching data, onto the screen instead of the Loading indicator. So this state is for that. It tells currently whether we have an error or not. Here it not a boolean but truly the error message.

Then after everything is finished, we set isLoading state back to false as seen towards the end of the try{} block of this function\n        const res = await fetch(\n          `http://www.omdbapi.com/?apiKey=${KEY}&s=${query}`\n        );\n\n        if (!res.ok)\n          throw new Error(\"Something went wrong with fetching movies!\"); // now in between fetching data, user's internet connection might break so app will always keep showing the Loading indicator making user beleive that data will arrive at some point. so when it happens we want to display an error message on screen. Now reacting to errors like this is not built into the fetch() function itself, we need to do it manually. Now here on the response object that we receive from the fetch() exists one ok property. So basically if the response is not ok, then we want to throw a new error. Now if we throw an error here, we need to wrap all our code into a try catch block.\n\n        const data = await res.json();\n        setMovies(data.Search);\n        console.log(movies); // here if we try to log the movies to the console, we get an empty array as a result. This happens becuase setting state is asynchronous. So after setting state in the just above line using setMovies(), it doesn't mean that it happens immediately. So it will happen after the function has been called. so right here in console.log(movies), we have stale state. So before, movies was just an empty array which gets logged. After some time we get the correct output. Now if we do this console.log() again, we get correct output. Now, the reson for getting two outputs is because of React's strict mode. So when strict mode is active in React 18, our effects will run not only once, but twice(but only in development. So when our application is in production, this will no longer be happening). This happens so REact can identify if there are some problems in our effects.\n      } catch (err) {\n        console.error(err.message); // err.message is the string that pass into throw new Error('') as above.\n        setError(err.message); // in case of error, we set the error state to the error string that we passed above while throwing error. Now based on this error state, we will conditionally render the ErrorMessage component which receives a messgae prop with some message that it will then display on the screen.\n      } finally {\n        setIsLoading(false); // Now in the returned JSX, we conditionally render the <Loader.> component if isLoading is true, but there are 2 more conditional renders with it. (Look and understand. if not understood, Watch Lecture 146 - Adding a loading state and Lecture 147 - Handling errors)\n      }\n    }\n    fetchMovies(); // here we just call the function\n  }, []); // useEffects() doesn't return anything so we don't store the resuukt into any variable but instead we pass in a function and this function is then called our effect and it contains the code that we want to run as a side effect(so basically that we want to register as a side effect to be executed at a certain point in time). We also need to pass in a second argumnent which is a dependency array. We'll learn about it as we proceed further. empty array as here means that the effect that we just specified here will only run on mount. Now ew can see that there are no infinite loops or requests. So now effect is only running as the component mounts. Now, whenever we need a lot of code to handle a promise, it's a lot easier and nicer to just have an async function. However if we write async nefore the function inside useEffect() here and use await inside it, we get an ESLint warning which tells us that effect callbacks are synchronous to prevent race conditions. So basically the effect function that we placed into useEffect() cannot return a promise which is what an async function does. So instead of doing diretly like this, we create a new function and place the async function there as we did here\n\n  // // We know we should never update state in render logic.\n  // // Basic idea is to fetch some movie data as soon as this App component here mounts for the very  first time.\n  // fetch(`http://www.omdbapi.com/?apiKey=${KEY}&s=interstellar`)\n  //   .then((res) => res.json())\n  //   .then((data) => console.log(data.Search)); // Now, this data fetching that we are doing here is actually introducing a side effect into the component's render logic. So it is clearly an interaction with an outside world which should never be allowed in render logic. Now, as we see here, if insetead of logging the fetched data on console, we set state here with the fetched data, in the Network tab we can see that it is running an infinite number of requests and it never really stops. So every second, our app is firing off multiple requests to this API. This happends because setting the state here in the render logic will then immediately cause the component to re-render itself again. However, as the component is re-rendered, the function here is executed again, which in turn will fetch again, which in turn will set the movies again as well and this whole thing starts over ad over again. So this is the reason why it is really not allowed to set state in the render logic. Now, we do actually need to set the movies here but without all the problems. So for that we need the useEffect() hoosk.\n\n  // // we see another example just below where wo use setWatched:\n  // // setWatched([[]]); // We did setWatched here immediately in the top level code to some empty array and then actually we do get a real error. We get the error of too many re-renders. It's because of this state setting right here in setWatched(). So if we are really setting state here in the top without being inside a .then() handler, then immediately REact will complain that there are too many renders which means we again entered that infinite loop where updating the state will cause a component to re-render, which will cause the state to be set, ad so on to infinity.\n\n  // so we can useEffect() hook for above. The idea of it is to give us a place where we can safely write side effects like the above one.

This prop drilling\n  //                               can be tedious if components are very deeply nested then\n  //                               we have to pass the prop through a lot of components. A\n  //                               solution of this problem of prop drilling is Component\n  //                               Composition. Component composition is combining\n  //                               different components using the children prop or\n  //                               explicitly defined props. Ex as just below:\n  //\n  //                               function Modal({ children }){\n  //                                 return (\n  //                                   <div className=\"modal\">\n  //                                     {children}\n  //                                   >/div>\n  //                                 )\n  //                               }\n  //\n  //                               function Error() {\n  //                                 return <p>This went wrong!</p>\n  //                               }\n  //\n  //                               Now with Component composition we can simply do:\n  //                               <Modal>\n  //                                 <Error />\n  //                               </Modal>\n  //\n  //                               We can use component composition:\n  //                               1. When we want to create highly reusable and\n  //                                  flexible components (such as the modal window)\n  //                               2. To fix prop drilling problem (great for layouts)\n  //\n  //                               Now we use component composition to fix component\n  //                               drilling problem where we pass movies prop into the\n  //                               NavBar component and then from there into the\n  //                               NumResults component. Here we only have one leve of prop\n  //                               drilling. If we could use NumResults component right in\n  //                               the App component instead of the NavBar component, then\n  //                               we wouldn't have to pass the movies prop into the NavBar\n  //                               which will fix that prop drilling problem. So we do this\n  //                               with component composition as above. So we pass children\n  //                               prop in the NavBar component function and inside it, write\n  //                               {children} in the returned <nav></nav> element after the\n  //                               <Logo/> component and in the App component, instead of\n  //                               just <Navbar/> we write it like an HTML element and inside\n  //                               it write <Search/> and <NumResults/> as:\n  //\n  //                               <NavBar>\n  //                                 <Search />\n  //                                 <NumResults movies={movies} />\n  //                               </NavBar>\n  //\n  //                               Similarly we do for <Main/> component and for any further\n  //                               component if needed\n  return (\n    <ul className=\"list\">\n      {movies?.map((movie) => (\n        <Movie movie={movie} key={movie.imdbID} />\n      ))}\n    </ul>\n
